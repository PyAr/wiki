##A personal home page is a nice place to publish data about yourself, like:
##    * who you are, what you do, what you like or dislike
##    * your phone number, email address or other contact data
##    * a photo of yourself
##
##You also can use it to keep things for yourself (and maybe also for others), like:
##    * your favourite links
##    * your todo list
##    * your notes
