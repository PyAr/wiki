We will all make a game in one week. You too. We will all participate in pyweek and build the biggest collaborative game ever! Be a part of the most awesome international development experience!

You can type? You can participate! For each level of knowledge, there's a way to create levels... you can participate if you never programmed or if you made two million games... you can participate if you want to spend 5 minutes or 7 days... this is for everyone!

If you want to know more, follow us on twitter, facebook, identi.ca and more! (add links)

get ready, we start on the end of march, we will post a definite date later this month.
